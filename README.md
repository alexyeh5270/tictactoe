TicTacToe Game

The game starts with an empty board and text that says "Welcome" ![image](https://github.com/alexyeh5270/tictactoe/assets/65560162/c02fd38d-5390-4f63-9648-4a232cefe72d)
Players can make a turn by clicking on one of the squares.  After every turn, the text displays who's turn it is next.  Player one automatically goes first with "X", then player two goes next with "O".  For example, this is the state of the board for the first move in the top-left corner.

Players keep alternating turns by clicking on a square, until one wins.  In this example, Player 1(X) has beat Player 2(O), by having three "X"'s in a row, diagonally.
